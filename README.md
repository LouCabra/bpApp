# Blood Pressure Monitor App

## Overview
The Blood Pressure Monitor App is a simple web application that allows users to track their blood pressure readings over time. The app enables manual data entry of systolic and diastolic values along with the date and time of each reading. It stores these readings locally on the user's device and provides basic statistical analysis and visualizations.

## Basic Functionality

### Difficulty
**Easy to Moderate**

### Description
This app is designed to help users monitor their blood pressure by allowing them to manually input readings and track their progress over time. The app displays the entered readings in a list and calculates basic statistics such as the average, highest, and lowest blood pressure readings. It also includes simple visualizations to show trends over time.

### Key Features
- **Data Entry:** Users can manually input their blood pressure readings (systolic and diastolic), as well as the date and time of each reading.
- **Data Storage:** The app uses LocalStorage to store readings locally on the user's device, ensuring data persists across sessions.
- **Display Data:** A list view shows all past readings along with their corresponding dates and times.
- **Basic Statistics:** The app calculates and displays the average, highest, and lowest systolic and diastolic readings.
- **Visualizations:** Simple line or bar charts are generated using Chart.js to visualize blood pressure trends over time.

## Technologies

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Handles data storage, calculations, and chart generation.

### Storage
- **LocalStorage:** Utilized for storing user data locally within the browser. This approach ensures that the data is retained even after the browser is closed and reopened, though it is only accessible on the same device and browser.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blood-pressure-monitor.git



### Suggestions Implemented:
1. **Instructions on Running the App**: Added detailed steps on how to clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and open the app in a browser.
2. **Future Enhancements**: Included ideas for future improvements, such as filtering, sorting, data export, and user authentication, to suggest how the app could be expanded upon.
3. **License**: Added a section on licensing to clarify the usage rights of the code.
